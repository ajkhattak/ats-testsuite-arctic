Series:

i) constant specified density, viscosity, no temperature
ii) constant specified temperature, EOS for density, viscosity
iii) adds energy equation, but with no flux bcs, constant initial temp (nearly isothermal)
iv) variation on (iii) which sets a surface rel perm to mimic the coupled surf/subsurf without surf
v) fully coupled surf/subsurf cases


test0: steady state, water only
test0b: same as test0, but higher water table
test1: water source, water only (ic = test0)
test2: freeze from below, subsurface only (ic = test0)
test3: cyclic temperature, constant gas saturation BC, subsurface only (ic = test2)
test4: coupled surface/subsurface, (subsurf ic = test2, surf ic is ponded ice layer), heat surface, melting surface ice, infiltrate into subsurf
test5: coupled surface/subsurface, (subsurf ic = test2, surf ic is ponded ice layer), heat surface with mass source (snowmelt), melting surface ice, infiltrate into subsurf
test6: coupled surface/subsurface + SEB
