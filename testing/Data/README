Met Data:
===================

All Met data should provide the following fields:

- "time [s]"
- "precipitation rain [m s^-1]"
- "precipitation snow [m SWE s^-1]"
- "air temperature [K]"
"relative humidity [-]"
- "incoming shortwave radiation [W m^-2]"
- "incoming longwave radiation [W m^-2]"  (optional!)
- "wind speed [m s^-1]"
- "wind speed height [m]"

Note that typically "time" is daily averages, and starts with 0 with
an interval of 86400 (seconds per day).


Data Products:
=================

spinup-10yr.h5:
-----------------

(Joel Rowland)
- 10 years (1 year data repeated 10 times)
- weather stations aroudn Barrow, window average (average all Jan 1 across 10 years, for all days)
- 2 meter wind speed reference height
- adjusted for undercatch to increase snowpack to reasonable sizes

variations:

- spinup-10yr-snowJan1.h5 is the same but dumps 35 cm of snow on
  Jan 1 of the first year to make up for the lack of most of fall's
  snowpack.  This is necessary for 2D runs where settng 35 cm as a
  uniform initial condition misses filtering that snowpack through the
  snow distribution model.

- spinup-10yr-T+6.h5 is a hack that simply increases the daily air
  temperature by 6 degrees to have something to work with for Seward.
  This will be replaced with real Seward data, and then should be
  removed.

- spinup-10yr-snowJan1-T+6.h5 does both of the above

Barrow-2010_2013.h5
---------------------
(Anna Liljedahl, her student at UAF?, Nathan Wales, others)

- Meterological data taken from various sources, includign teh Barrow
  airport and eddy flux towers in the BEO, then corrected using
  snowpack surveys and others.

- Jan 1 2010 -- Dec 31 2013 by Anna and her student, 2014 -- 20?? by
  Nathan Wales

- daily averaged
