comparison suite
----------------

comparison 0: physics of the freeze-thaw front
Comparison of the parameter for smoothing both above and belowground freeze-thaw curves


comparison 1: physics of the surface water flow
Comparison of Manning's coefficient

comparison 2: discretization
MFD vs TPFA

comparison 3: Jacobian terms
Available Jacobian terms include:
none) base terms i.e. Jones and Woodward style PC
a) dkr / dp
b) dKappa / dT
c) dcond_s / dp_s (NOT WORKING!)
d) dKappa_s / dT_s (likely not working too, but surely this is not helpful) 
e) d(q_adv) / dT
f) d(q_adv_s) / dT_s
g) dkr / dT
h) dKappa / dp
i) dadv / d (p,T)  (cannot be used with e, as this should include e and more)

comparison 4: boomer amg/pc options
i) ilu
b1) boomer amg, crazy lightweight
b2) boomer amg, middleweidght, strong threshold = 0.85
b2a) middleweight with 0.25 strong threshold
b2b) middleweight with 0.5 strong threshold
b2c) middleweight with 0.95 strong threshold
b3) boomer amg, heavyweight (limit of linear solver), also includes tighter linear tolerance!

comparison 5: globalization part 1
Looking at with and without limiters, and magnitude of limiter
a) control, no limiters
b1) no temp limiter, pressure limiter = 40k
b2) no temp limiter, pressure limiter = 400k
b3) no temp limiter, pressure limiter = 4000k
c1) no pressure limiter, temp limiter = 0.1
c2) no pressure limiter, temp limiter = 1
c3) no pressure limiter, temp limiter = 10
d) pressure limiter = 400k, temp limiter = 1


comparison 6: predictors
a) no prediction
b) linear extrapolation
c) extrap + spurt 
d1) extrap + EWC as is
d2) extrap + EWC with 0 trans widths
d3) extrap + EWC with 0.1 trans widths
d4) extrap + EWC with 0.4 trans widths (same as smoothing)
d5) extrap + EWC with 1 trans widths
